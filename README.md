# Predictive Analysis â€“ Electrical car 
The objective of this project is to develop a precise machine learning model using Python for automating various tasks. These tasks include 
- predicting the car with the quickest 0-100 acceleration
- identifying the vehicle with the highest efficiency
- analyzing the influence of powertrain variations on range, top speed, and efficiency
- determining the manufacturer with the largest number of vehicles, and investigating the correlation between price and rapid charging. 
The primary focus of the model will be to optimize accuracy in order to achieve reliable predictions for these tasks.





## Model Used
For the analysis of the relationship between top speed, efficiency, and price, I propose using a Linear Regression model. This model will help describe the correlation between these variables. To evaluate the model's performance, I will utilize metrics such as R-square or adjusted R-square. Additionally, mean square error or mean absolute error will be employed as metrics to assess the performance of the regression model.
